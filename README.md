# Swim!!
A small game built with Delphi + FMX + Skia4Delphi

## Intro

Taking on the role of a fish, you have to be vigilant for obstacles that include larger predators, poisonous jelly fish, aggressive sharks, hungry fishermen awaiting crispy fried fish fillets for dinner, and naval mines that are gonna tear you apart.

Always check the numbers that are going backwards in the green circle at the top right corner. It shows how much energy you have. Low energy? Not a big deal! Boost your energy by munching smaller fish. As smaller fish are eaten, you grow in size and become capable of eating larger fish.

Donâ€™t forget to collect as many collect coins as you can along the way. The more coins you collect, the higher score you gain. Once you have collected 100 gold coins, wait for a miracle to happen.

Have fun!!

## Why I chose [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) + FMX + Skia4Delphi
1. Object Pascal is a neat language. It is very easy to learn.
2. Rapid application development: I could get the UI of the application quickly. In some cases, I don't need to write any single line of code for my application.
3. Cross platform
4. FMX make graphic development easily. I could get the effects on application by drop some components.
5. [Skia4Delphi](https://github.com/skia4delphi/skia4delphi) makes the app runs smooth on Android. There is a contest for now, you could find more information from [here](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/skia4delphi-gui-beauty-contest/).
